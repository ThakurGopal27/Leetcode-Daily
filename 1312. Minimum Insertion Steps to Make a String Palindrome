Hint
(1/2)
Is dynamic programming suitable for this problem ?
If we know the longest palindromic sub-sequence is x and the length of the string is n then, what is the answer to this problem? It is n - x as we need n - x insertions to make the remaining characters also palindrome.

        int n = s.length();

            int prev = 0;

                int temp = dp[j];
